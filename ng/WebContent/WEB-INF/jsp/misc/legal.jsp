      Customisation of this website requires that our server can identify the computer and web browser that requests data over a
      period of time. To do this, a small file is saved on the user's computer. This file contains no personal data, only an
      encrypted numeric identifier. Visitors' page settings are stored in a user database against this identifier, making it
      possible for us to save your settings without storing any other information about you.
